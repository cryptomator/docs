Vault Management
================

The central entities in Cryptomator Hub are vaults.
In Hub, every vault contains a key to encrypt and decrypt your data stored in the cloud of your choice.
Hub manages access to the vaults, it does not store any encrypted user data.
This section describes how to manage vaults in Cryptomator Hub.


.. _hub/vault-management/vault-list:

Vault List
----------

The vault list is the main page of Cryptomator Hub.
Here, all vaults which are shared with you, are listed.
After signing in, Hub redirects you to this list.
Alternatively, you can also access the list by clicking on the ``Vaults`` tab in the navigation bar.

.. note::

    * As a user, you will only see the vaults that you have access to.
    * As an admin of the Hub instance, you can see all vaults, but you can only access those that you have been granted access to.


.. _hub/vault-management/create-vault:

Create a Vault
--------------

To create a vault in Hub, navigate to the vault list and click on the ``Create Vault`` button in the top right corner.
Every vault has a name and optionally a description.
Fill out the form and continue the process by clicking the ``Next`` button in the right corner.

In the next step, the vault *recovery key* is displayed.
It can :ref:`restore access to the vault data <hub/vault-recovery>` in case of an emergency, e.g. if Cryptomator Hub is down.
Store it at a safe location, tick the checkbox and complete the setup by clicking the ``Create Vault`` button at the bottom

    :width: 920px

.. warning::
    The recovery key is **highly confidential**.
    It is a human readable form of the vault :ref:`masterkey <security/architecture/masterkey>`, which is used to encrypt your data and independent of the key management in Cryptomator Hub.

When the setup is finished, you have the opportunity to download the initial vault template and place it in your desired cloud storage location.
You can unlock the vault and place data inside with `Cryptomator <https://cryptomator.org/downloads/>`_.
If you skip this step, you can download the template :ref:`later <hub/vault-management/download-vault-template>`.

To open it, navigate to the vault list and click on entry in the list.

Update Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If members of the vault have finished the :ref:`first login <hub/your-account/setup>` or reset user accounts, a vault owner must explicitly grant access to these users.

You can do that if you skipped the download vault template step during the vault creation.

.. _hub/vault-management/import-vault:

Import a Vault
--------------

If you have a existing, password-based Cryptomator vault and want to switch to centralized, password-less user access management, you can import the vault in Cryptomator Hub.
For a successful import, the :ref:`recovery key<desktop/password-and-recovery-key/show-recovery-key>` of the vault and write access to its storage location is needed

The import is done via the Hub vault recovery feature.
Follow the :ref:`vault online recovery guide <hub/vault-recovery/online-recovery>` and use the recovery key of the password-based vault in the process.
Don't forget to replace the vault config file ``vault.cryptomator`` at the vault storage location at the end.
Finally, to ensure that the vault cannot be unlocked with its old password anymore, remove the file ``masterkey.cryptomator`` and all backup files ( ending with ``.bkup``).
