Setup
=====

Cryptomator Hub is a zero-knowledge key management solution that allows you to manage access to your vaults from a central component deployed on your own infrastructure.

Quickstart
----------

#. Decide, on which web addresses you want to deploy Hub and Keycloak (and set up DNS and TLS termination, if required)

#. Use the `Setup Wizard <https://cryptomator.org/hub/setup/>`_ to generate a deployment descriptor template

#. Customize the template if needed (e.g., adjust the Ingress settings) and deploy the software stack to your cluster

#. Log in to Keycloak to

   * adjust authentication settings
   * set up users/groups or LDAP/AD

#. Log in to Cryptomator Hub and start creating Hub-managed vaults

More Details
------------

To get started, use the `Setup Wizard <https://cryptomator.org/hub/setup/>`_ to generate the necessary configuration files.

Cryptomator Hub depends on `Keycloak <https://www.keycloak.org/>`_, an open-source identity and access management solution. That means, Hub manages access to your vaults whereas Keycloak manages users, groups, and authentication. In the Setup Wizard, you will have the option to choose between deploying Keycloak alongside Hub or specifying an URL to an existing Keycloak installation.

Keycloak Administration
-----------------------

Using Keycloak, you can `create users <https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-creating-user_server_administration_guide>`_, `delete users <https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-creating-user_server_administration_guide>`_, `manage groups <https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-managing-groups_server_administration_guide>`_, and optionally also synchronize users/groups to Keycloak using `LDAP <https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_ldap>`_ or other identity providers to whom you can then give access to vaults in Hub.

.. note::

    Subgroups are not supported at this time.
