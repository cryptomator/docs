.. note::

    If you already have a vault created with the desktop app and just want to add this vault to your mobile app, please select go to chapter ``Add Existing Vaults``.

You will now be prompted to select the Cloud Service where you want to store your vault.

Choose between *Dropbox*, *Google Drive*, *OneDrive* (works also with *OneDrive for Business*) or *Local storage* (which means your local device with all attached devices).

| If your desired provider is not listed and offers WebDAV access, please select *WebDAV* as the storage location of your vault.
| Please see :ref:`misc/supported-cloud-services/clouds-with-webdav-support` for a non-exhaustive list of Cloud Services
  and information about accessing them with WebDAV.

If not already done, you have to create the connection between the Cryptomator app and your storage provider account. Please follow the instructions in the :ref:`Cloud Management <android/cloud-management>` chapter and continue later here.

Now that you've established a connection, you'll add the existing vault.

In the first step, please enter a name for your new vault.
This name will also be the folder name of your vault files in your online storage.

Then choose the location on your Cloud Service where you want to have your encrypted vault files stored.

And last but not least, create a **secure** password for your vault.
Basically, you have the whole Unicode for choosing a password including non-printable characters.

    :width: 346px

.. warning::

    You have to remember this password at all times because there is **no way to access your data if you forget your password**.
    Choose a :ref:`good password <security/best-practices/good-passwords>` to make your data secure.

After you have confirmed your password, the vault is created.
You will find it now on the start page of your Cryptomator app, where you can open your vault and optionally change settings. [documentation will follow]

.. image:: ../img/android/change-password-vault-1-select-change-pw.png
    :alt: How to change a vault password with Android
    :width: 346px

Enter the old password and choose a **secure** new one.
Basically, you have the whole Unicode for choosing a password including non-printable characters.

.. image:: ../img/android/change-password-vault-2-change-password.png
    :alt: How to change a vault password with Android
    :width: 346px

.. warning::

    You have to remember this password at all times because there is **no way to access your data if you forget your password**.
    Choose a :ref:`good password <security/best-practices/good-passwords>` to make your data secure.

Start the process using the ``CHANGE PASSWORD`` button.

.. image:: ../img/android/change-password-vault-4-finish.png
    :alt: How to change a vault password with Android
    :width: 346px

.. note::

    The password is used to derive a `KEK <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary*of*cryptographic*keys>`_, which is then used to encrypt futher keys.
    The KEK changes, but the keys encrypted with the KEK will stay the same.
    The actual files will not get re-encrypted, meaning you can not upgrade a weak passphrase to a stronger one once the data has been synced to a service that allows recovery of older versions of the masterkey file.

If you like to encrypt your vault files with a new, stronger password, you need to create a new vault and copy the data from the old to the new one. Make sure to wipe all backups of the old vault afterwards.

.. _android/vault-management/rename-vault:

Rename Vault
------------

If you want to change the name of a specific vault in Cryptomator, you select the ``V`` next to the vault ① and choose *Rename* ②.
