# Setup

You can get Cryptomator for iOS on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/cryptomator/id1560822163).

Cryptomator is available for free with in-app purchases. The free version gives you read-only access to your vaults. With the in-app purchase, you can unlock the full version to gain write access to your vaults. You can also try out the full version free for 30 days.

## Full Version {#full-version}

A full version of Cryptomator without in-app purchases is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/cryptomator-full-version/id1665616242) as well. This version is unlisted and only available via the direct link.

The "Full Version" is basically the same as Cryptomator with the in-app purchase "Full Version" unlocked. This app is available for interested parties using Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager that are unable to buy in-app purchases. Or if you want to gift the app to your friends or family.

## Requirements {#requirements}

Requires iOS 14.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
