# Best Practices

## Sharing of Vaults {#sharing-of-vaults}

When sharing your vault or working in a team, we strongly recommend using [Cryptomator Hub](https://cryptomator.org/for-teams/).
It adds access management for your vaults and allows you to unlock vaults with your own account.

Otherwise, always be careful when sharing your vault with other people.

In general, keep your vault password secret.
Nobody except yourself should know the vault password.
Sharing your vault password should be reserved for very limited personal scenarios (for example, with your spouse) and is generally not advised.
Keep in mind that other people could pass on – with or without intent – the vault password.
Only share your vaults with people you trust.

If you share a vault with others, do not communicate the vault password on an insecure channel.
Tell the password in person, use encrypted email or messengers or other similar secure means.

## Good Passwords {#good-passwords}

Bad passwords can be cracked easily when using computers.
Plenty of recommendations exist for secure passwords.
Some of these are:

* A password should not contain public or personal information like the name of your pet, date of birth, or username.
* A password should be long.
* A password should not be an existing word or a combination of few words. It should be a combination of characters or words that is as random as possible.
* For each purpose, a unique password without similarities to other passwords should be used.

If you fulfill these requirements, you quickly reach a point where remembering the passwords gets impossible.
Thus, we recommend using a password manager to generate and store the passwords.
By doing so, you only have to remember a few or a single secure password.
Otherwise, we recommend using at least 10 characters, ideally [use sentences instead of words](https://xkcd.com/936/).

## Backup Strategy {#backup-strategy}

Cryptomator is not a backup solution.
Its primary and only purpose is client-side encryption.

We strongly recommend maintaining your own backup strategy.
Even with unencrypted data, regular backups are essential.

Most cloud storage services offer some form of backup or file revision capabilities.
Evaluate if those available measures are sufficient for your needs or consider implementing additional backup systems.
