# Download

The latest versions for all operating systems are provided on the [Cryptomator downloads page](https://cryptomator.org/downloads).

You can find older releases as well as detailed changelogs in the [GitHub release section](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases).

# Installation

## Windows

Launch the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the setup as usual. We recommend also installing _Dokany_, which is included in the installer.

!!! note
    If you are updating Cryptomator by installing a new version and additionally want to update Dokany, you need to remove the old Dokany version first, restart the PC, and then execute the Cryptomator installer.

## macOS

Open the downloaded `.dmg` file, accept the license, and drag & drop Cryptomator onto the Applications folder. We recommend also installing _FUSE for macOS_, which is linked from inside the `.dmg` file.

!!! note
    In case the application is blocked by Gatekeeper, you need to change your [Gatekeeper settings](https://support.apple.com/HT202491){: rel="external"}.

## Linux

The primary option of using Cryptomator on Linux is via the AppImage. After you've downloaded the `.appimage` file, you simple need to [make it executable](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html#running-appimages){: rel="external"} and you can then run it.

If you are familiar with `PPA` or `AUR`, you can choose one of these options to install Cryptomator. The coordinates are available on our download page.
