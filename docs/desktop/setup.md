## Install Cryptomator on Windows {#install-cryptomator-on-windows}

1. Download Cryptomator's `.exe` installer for Windows from our [downloads page](https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#win).
2. Launch the `.exe` installer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Install Cryptomator on macOS {#install-cryptomator-on-macos}

1. Download Cryptomator's `.dmg` installer for macOS from our [downloads page](https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#mac).
2. Launch the `.dmg` installer.
3. Accept the license.
4. Drag & drop Cryptomator into the Applications folder.

On macOS, Cryptomator will use WebDAV volume type by default if no FUSE driver is installed on the system. But we recommend installing *macFUSE* or *FUSE-T* for a smoother file browsing experience.
Install *macFUSE* if your Mac comes with an Intel CPU or install *FUSE-T* if your Mac comes with an Apple Silicon CPU.

:::note
Change your [Gatekeeper settings](https://support.apple.com/HT202491) if macOS blocks Cryptomator's installation.

## Install Cryptomator on Linux {#install-cryptomator-on-linux}

Cryptomator is available on Linux via `Flatpak`, `PPA` and `AUR` package managers, and as an AppImage (an `.appimage` file).

The easiest and recommended way of installing Cryptomator on Linux is by downloading Cryptomator's AppImage (an `.appimage` file) - as it works on almost all distributions. 
Just remember to [make it executable](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html#running-appimages) before you try to run it.

Visit our [downloads page](https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#linux) to choose your preferred installation method.
