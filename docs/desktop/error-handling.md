# Error Handling

If you encounter an unexpected error, Cryptomator gives you the option to look up a solution in our error database. It's possible that the error has already been reported and a solution has been suggested for you to follow.

Simply click the `Look up Solution` button.

We will cross-reference your current error with the database and provide a solution link if one is available.

If no results are found, you have the option to initiate your own search by selecting `Look up this error`, or create a ticket by selecting `Report this error`.
