# Glossary

## Terms {#terms}

### Account Key {#account-key}
A sequence of digits and characters that looks like this: `535cf7e3-f305-4d97-9309-dcce813183cf`. It is used to authorize new devices to access your Cryptomator Hub account. It can be looked up in the profile of existing devices. If you lose it, you can reset your account, however doing so will revoke access from all vaults.

### Recovery Key {#recovery-key}
A human-readable representation of a vault's master key that is supposed to be printed out and archived for the case that you ever forget or lose access to your regular passphrase.

## Localization of Terms {#localization}

:::warning

Some of the terms mentioned above are carefully chosen to be distinguishable from another. This is particularly important for key material, as we deal with many different kinds of keys. **Mixing these up can cause confusion or even bear the risk of information exposure.**

:::

Translating technical terms shall be considered with great care. Here are our official recommendations to translators:

1. If using English terms in the realm of software is common practice in your native language, *do not translate* these terms.
2. Otherwise, if you feel uncertain about a translation, then better put the English term in parenthesis (if there is enough room).
3. Only if you are absolutely confident, that a translation precisely reflects the meaning as defined in this glossary, translate it.

:::note

We may add further terms in the future. If, for example, you deem it acceptable to translate _account_ to something that has the same meaning as _user_, keep in mind that a translation of _account key_ may eventually collide with _user key_.
